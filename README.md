Semantic Similarity: Measures how closely the student response matches the ideal answer.

Grammar & Coherence Check: Evaluates sentence structure and readability.

Keyword Matching: Identifies essential terms for accuracy assessment.

Scoring System: Generates a score based on predefined evaluation criteria.

Web-Based Interface: Users can upload or type responses for assessment.


Technologies Used


Programming Language: Python

Frameworks: Flask/Django (for web interface)

NLP Libraries: SpaCy, NLTK, BERT, or OpenAI GPT

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL (for storing responses and evaluations)
